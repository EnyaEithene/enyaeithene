## Hi there 👋

I'm Enya, and as an Applied Mathematics and CS undergraduate I love experimenting with: 
- appearence and style using CSS;
- data managing using SQL and MariaDB;
- utilities with bash or Python;
- any other app that allows file or information managing and sharing.

Currently pursuing a Master's degree.
